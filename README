                              testing.h
                             ===========

This is a very small header-only library to simplify writing C++
unit tests. It is simple, doesn't have any external dependencies,
provides nicely coloured and verbose output and a basic set of
invariant checks (including testing of exception throwing) to make
test writing faster and cleaner.

To use this in your project, you may just grab testing.h and add
it to your source tree.

Short example
=============

  #include "testing.h"

  BEGIN_TEST()
      EXPECT_TRUE(1 == 1);
      EXPECT_STRING(MyFunctionReturningString(), "expected output");
      EXPECT_EXCEPTION(MyFunctionWhichShouldThrow(), std::runtime_error);
  END_TEST()

Longer example
==============

  See example.cc, which may be compiled and ran with simply calling
  `make'.
